# Product Context

*This document explains the "why" behind the project, the problems it aims to solve, how it should function from a user perspective, and the overall user experience goals.*

## Problem Statement

*   Rob McLaughlin needs a simple, professional, yet personality-infused online presence (a digital business card) to showcase his profile to the tech community, recruiters, and peers.
*   Existing personal websites might be too generic or lack a distinct aesthetic; this project aims for a memorable "lo-fi chill" theme inspired by lofi.cafe.

## Target Audience

*   Fellow Developers
*   Recruiters / Potential Employers
*   Tech Community Members
*   Potential Collaborators

## Proposed Solution

*   A minimal single-page web application built with Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS.
*   The site will feature Rob's name, title/tagline, and links to professional profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).
*   A distinct "lo-fi cafe" visual aesthetic will be implemented (dark theme, retro elements, potentially subtle animations) to make the site memorable and reflect personal style.
*   The site will be deployed to `robmclaughl.in` with a clean, maintainable codebase and infrastructure for future expansion.

## Functional Overview (MVP)

*   **Landing Page:** Displays all content on a single page.
*   **Content Display:** Shows name, title, and contact links/icons.
*   **Links:** Contact elements are clickable hyperlinks leading to external profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub) or email.
*   **Responsiveness:** Layout adapts cleanly to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
*   **No Interaction (MVP):** Beyond clicking links, there are no forms, logins, or dynamic features.

## User Experience (UX) Goals

*   **Aesthetic:** Achieve a "lo-fi chill" vibe â€“ calming, retro, dark-themed, potentially with subtle animations (e.g., grainy filter, neon/pixelated text hints, pulsating icon). Inspired by lofi.cafe.
*   **Simplicity:** Minimalist content presentation; easy to scan and find key information (name, links).
*   **Professionalism:** Despite the theme, maintain a clean, modern, and professional appearance suitable for the target audience.
*   **Responsiveness:** Seamless experience across all device sizes.
*   **Performance:** Fast load times.
*   **Accessibility:** Adhere to basic accessibility standards for readability and navigation.

## Success Metrics (MVP)

*   Successful deployment of the single-page site to `robmclaughl.in` with HTTPS.
*   Visual implementation matches the intended lo-fi aesthetic.
*   All core content (name, title, links) is present and correct.
*   The site is fully responsive across major device breakpoints.
*   Clean codebase and infrastructure setup confirmed (e.g., via code review, successful CI/CD pipeline run).
*   Positive initial feedback from the primary stakeholder (Rob McLaughlin).
