# Project Progress

*This document tracks the overall status of the project, what components are functional, what remains to be built, known issues, and the evolution of key decisions.*

## Current Status (as of March 23, 2025)

*   Next.js application prototype completed.
*   Core UI components (including custom ones like `HeroBackground`) implemented with lo-fi theme and responsiveness.
*   Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) configuration created for AWS deployment (S3, CloudFront, Route53, IAM).
*   CI/CD pipeline set up using GitHub Actions.
*   Project is awaiting initial deployment and further refinement.

## What Works

*   **Frontend:**
    *   Next.js project structure (App Router).
    *   Lo-fi themed UI with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui.
    *   Responsive layout.
    *   Custom components: `CoffeeCup`, `Waveform`, `HeroBackground` (with video/image background, effects, optimizations).
    *   Social links implemented.
*   **Infrastructure & Deployment:**
    *   Terraform scripts for AWS resources (S3, CloudFront, Route53, ACM, IAM Role).
    *   GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD.
    *   Deployment scripts created.

## What's Left to Build / Next Steps

*   **Deployment:**
    *   Execute Terraform scripts to provision AWS infrastructure.
    *   Configure GitHub repository secrets for the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Perform initial end-to-end deployment test.
*   **Content & Refinement:**
    *   Finalize website content (text, links).
    *   Performance testing and optimization.
    *   Further UI/UX enhancements (e.g., light/dark mode toggle).
*   **Future Phases (Post-MVP):**
    *   Add analytics (optional).
    *   Consider blog functionality.
    *   Implement dynamic content or advanced features.

## Known Issues & Bugs

*   Initial deployment has not yet occurred.
*   Full end-to-end testing of the deployment pipeline is pending.
*   Content needs final review and refinement.

## Decision Log / Evolution

*   Project follows a phased approach (MVP first, then expansion). See `projectbrief.md`.
*   Progress tracking moved from root to `docs/PROGRESS.md`.
*   Adopted Next.js App Router, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Terraform, AWS (S3/CloudFront), and GitHub Actions as key technologies. See `techContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md`.
*   Emphasis on Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and automated CI/CD from the start.
