# Project Progress - robmclaughl.in

## Current Status
- Next.js application prototype completed and deployed
- Core UI components implemented with lo-fi theme and responsiveness
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) configuration created and successfully applied
- CI/CD pipeline set up with GitHub Actions and operational
- Site is live at `robmclaughl.in`
- Security review completed and improvements implemented

## Completed Tasks

### Frontend Development
- ✅ Created Next.js project with App Router
- ✅ Implemented lo-fi themed design with enhanced UI elements
- ✅ Added responsive layout with mobile optimizations
- ✅ Integrated shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Built custom components (CoffeeCup, Waveform, HeroBackground)
- ✅ Added decorative elements and animations
- ✅ Implemented social links with hover effects

### HeroBackground Component Implementation
- ✅ Created fullscreen background video component
- ✅ Implemented performance optimizations:
  - Used `preload="metadata"` for efficient loading
  - Added Intersection Observer to pause video when off-screen
  - Added support for multiple formats (MP4/WebM)
- ✅ Added visual effects:
  - Semi-transparent overlay
  - Noise texture using inline SVG
  - CRT-style scanlines
  - Subtle hover brightness/contrast effect
- ✅ Ensured responsive behavior with mobile image fallback
- ✅ Added accessibility features:
  - Support for prefers-reduced-motion
  - Proper ARIA attributes
  - Error handling with fallbacks

#### Integration Notes
To use the HeroBackground component, you'll need:

1. An image in `/public/videos/` for video fallback (while proper video is created)
2. Wrap your content within the HeroBackground component
3. Set appropriate overlay color that complements your design

Example usage in page.tsx:
```tsx
<HeroBackground 
  videoSrc="/videos/your-video.mp4" 
  videoWebmSrc="/videos/your-video.webm" // Optional WebM version
  mobileBackgroundImage="/path/to/static-image.jpg"
  overlayColor="rgba(13, 16, 45, 0.5)"
>
  {/* Your page content goes here */}
</HeroBackground>
```

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Terraform configuration for AWS resources
  - S3 bucket for static content (with public access blocked)
  - CloudFront distribution with HTTPS, OAC, security headers, and access logging
  - ACM certificate
  - Route53 DNS records
  - IAM role for GitHub Actions with least privilege permissions
  - S3 backend for Terraform state with DynamoDB locking
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployments using pnpm
- ✅ Added deployment scripts
- ✅ Configured deployment environment variables
- ✅ Successfully deployed to production

## In Progress
- Content refinement
- Performance testing
- Additional UI/UX enhancements
- Baseline UI testing implementation (Cypress)

## Next Steps
- Implement baseline UI tests using Cypress
- Add analytics (optional)
- Consider adding blog functionality in future iteration
- Implement light/dark mode toggle

## Project Goals
- Create a minimal, lo-fi themed personal site
- Ensure fully responsive design
- Serve securely over HTTPS
- Build with maintainable, extendable architecture
- Optimize for performance and SEO

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (Current): MVP with core functionality and deployment
- Phase 2 (Future): Content expansion and additional features
- Phase 3 (Future): Advanced interactivity and dynamic content

## Security Improvements (April 4, 2025)
- ✅ Migrated from CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) to Origin Access Control (OAC)
- ✅ Enabled CloudFront access logging to a dedicated S3 bucket
- ✅ Implemented a Response Headers Policy with security headers:
  - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
  - Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - Referrer-Policy
  - X-XSS-Protection
- ✅ Removed unnecessary S3 permissions from the GitHub Actions IAM role
- ✅ Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use pnpm and removed redundant flags
- ✅ Enabled S3 backend for Terraform state with DynamoDB locking
